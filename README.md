## Testing Guide

### Test Business Review URLs

You can test different businesses by using the `?business=` query parameter:

| Business ID        | URL Example                                                                 | Expected Output Screenshot |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `restaurant-abc`   | [http://localhost:3000/review?business=restaurant-abc](http://localhost:3000/review?business=restaurant-abc) | [ðŸ“¸ View](./screenshots/restaurant-abc.png) |
| `salon-xyz`        | [http://localhost:3000/review?business=salon-xyz](http://localhost:3000/review?business=salon-xyz)           | [ðŸ“¸ View](./screenshots/salon-xyz.png)      |
| `garage-123`       | [http://localhost:3000/review?business=garage-123](http://localhost:3000/review?business=garage-123)         | [ðŸ“¸ View](./screenshots/garage-123.png)     |
| `invalid-business` | [http://localhost:3000/review?business=invalid-business](http://localhost:3000/review?business=invalid-business) | [ðŸ“¸ View](./screenshots/invalid-business.png) |

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [x] Star ratings 4â€“5 redirect to Google  
- [x] Star ratings 1â€“3 show feedback form  
- [x] Form validation works (required fields, phone format)  
- [x] Valid submissions are stored in `data/submissions.json`  
- [x] All interactions are logged in `data/interactions.json`  
- [x] Responsive layout works on mobile

## Architecture & Assumptions

### Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express
- **Storage**: Local JSON files (no database)
- **Test Framework**: Jest with jsdom

### Key Assumptions

- Each business is identified via a unique `business_id` passed in the query string.
- Business config (name, description, GMB URL, background image) is stored in `data/businesses.json`.
- A rating of **4 or 5** is considered "happy"; **1â€“3** triggers the internal feedback form.
- Submissions and interactions are persistently logged in flat JSON files.
- Users won't access this app concurrently at high scale (i.e., JSON file writes are acceptable).

---

## Known Limitations / Areas for Improvement

- No user authentication or spam protection on the feedback form  
- No admin dashboard or analytics UI yet  
- JSON file writes may not be suitable for production use (consider DB for scalability)  
- No input sanitization on server (XSS prevention recommended)  
- Form reset doesn't persist user state on refresh  
- No progressive web app (PWA) capabilities yet
